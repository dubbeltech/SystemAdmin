Problem:

One of the Nautilus developers has copied confidential data on the jump host in Stratos DC. 
That data must be copied to one of the app servers. Because developers do not have access to app servers, 
they asked the system admins team to accomplish the task for them.

Copy /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg file from jump server to App Server 1 at location /home/webapp.


Solution:

command to copy: scp /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg tony@172.16.238.10:/home/webapp
tony@172.16.238.10's password: 
name of the file: nautilus.txt.gpg
